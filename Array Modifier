#PROBLEM <Array Modifier>
#You are given an array with integers. Write a program to modify the elements after receiving the following commands:
#	•	"multiply {index1} {index2}" takes element at the 1st index and multiply it with the element at 2nd index. Save the product at the 1st index.
#	•	"decrease" decreases all elements in the array with 1.

# On the first input line, you will be given the initial array values separated by a single space.
# On the next lines you will receive commands until you receive the command "end". The commands are as follow: 
#	•	"swap {index1} {index2}"
#	•	"multiply {index1} {index2}"
#	•	"decrease"

#The output should be printed on the console and consist of elements of the modified array – separated by a comma and a single space ", ".

        index_2 = int(args[2])
        num_array[index_1], num_array[index_2] = num_array[index_2], num_array[index_1]

    elif action == 'multiply':
        index_1 = int(args[1])
        index_2 = int(args[2])
        num_array[index_1] = num_array[index_1] * num_array[index_2]

        num_array = [int(x)-1 for x in num_array]
